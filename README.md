"# Predictive-maintenance-For-Equipment" 
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a predictive maintenance model that can predict machine failures, allowing for proactive maintenance and reducing downtime. The dataset consists of sensor readings for various machines, and the task is to classify the failures based on these readings.

Dataset
Dataset Source: The dataset used is the Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification dataset from Kaggle.
Dataset Features:
UDI (Unique Device Identifier)
Air Temperature [K]
Process Temperature [K]
Rotational Speed [rpm]
Torque [Nm]
Tool Wear [min]
Failure Types (e.g., Overstrain, Power Failure, Tool Wear Failure)
Target: Failure or No Failure
Steps to Reproduce
1. Install Required Libraries
You can install the required Python libraries using requirements.txt:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can manually install libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
